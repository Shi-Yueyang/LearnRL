Perfect — let’s go deep into **DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient)**.

It was designed as a **continuous-action extension of DQN**, using an **actor–critic setup**.

---

# 🔹 Core Idea

* DQN can’t handle continuous action spaces because it needs to compute
  $\max_a Q(s,a)$, which is infeasible when $a \in \mathbb{R}^n$.
* **DDPG replaces the max step with an actor network** that directly outputs the best action.
* It’s basically:

  * **Critic:** learns Q-values
  * **Actor:** learns a policy to maximize those Q-values

---

# 🔹 Networks in DDPG

1. **Actor (policy network)**

   $$
   a = \mu(s; \phi)
   $$

   * Input: state $s$
   * Output: continuous action $a$

2. **Critic (Q-network)**

   $$
   Q(s, a; \theta)
   $$

   * Input: state $s$ and action $a$
   * Output: scalar Q-value (expected return)

---

# 🔹 Target Networks

* Just like DQN, DDPG uses **target actor** $\mu'(s; \phi^-)$ and **target critic** $Q'(s,a;\theta^-)$.
* They are updated slowly (soft updates) to stabilize learning:

  $$
  \theta^- \leftarrow \tau \theta + (1-\tau)\theta^-, \quad \phi^- \leftarrow \tau \phi + (1-\tau)\phi^-
  $$

---

# 🔹 Critic Update

The target value is:

$$
y = r + \gamma (1 - \text{done}) Q'\big(s', \mu'(s'; \phi^-); \theta^-\big)
$$

The critic minimizes the TD error:

$$
L(\theta) = \Big( Q(s,a;\theta) - y \Big)^2
$$

---

# 🔹 Actor Update

The actor is updated to maximize the critic’s Q-value:

$$
J(\phi) = \mathbb{E}[ Q(s, \mu(s;\phi); \theta) ]
$$

Using the **deterministic policy gradient theorem**:

$$
\nabla_\phi J(\phi) = \mathbb{E}\Big[ \nabla_a Q(s,a;\theta)\big|_{a=\mu(s)} \, \nabla_\phi \mu(s;\phi) \Big]
$$

This means:

* Critic tells the actor “how good” an action is.
* Actor adjusts its parameters in the direction that **increases Q-value**.

---

# 🔹 Exploration

* Since the actor is deterministic ($a = \mu(s)$), DDPG adds **noise** to encourage exploration:

  * Gaussian noise
  * Or Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (original paper, good for smooth control tasks).

$$
a_t = \mu(s_t;\phi) + \mathcal{N}_t
$$

---

# 🔹 Training Loop (Simplified)

1. Get state $s$.
2. Actor chooses action $a = \mu(s) + \text{noise}$.
3. Step in env → get $(s', r, done)$.
4. Store $(s,a,r,s')$ in replay buffer.
5. Sample minibatch.
6. Update critic using TD target.
7. Update actor using policy gradient.
8. Soft update target networks.
9. Repeat.

---

# 🔹 Summary

* **DQN**: Value-based, works only for discrete actions.
* **DDPG**: Actor–critic, extends DQN to **continuous actions**.

  * Critic = Q-learning
  * Actor = replaces the $\max_a$ step
  * Uses replay buffer + target networks for stability
  * Uses noise for exploration
